        Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittse]) is a savory dish of Italian origin
        consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped
        with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms,
        onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
        traditionally in a wood-fired oven. [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
        A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
